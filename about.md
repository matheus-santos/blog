---

Hi! My name is Matheus,

I am a brazillian software engineer. I like to build stuff and am curious about how things works. I have a bachelor degree in Computer Science and I am passionate by my job and technology in genereal.

My topic interests are Artificial Intelligence, Programming, Entrepreneurship, Project Management, Leadership, Business, Robots, Neuroscience, Philosophy and Jiu Jitsu. As a hobby I love to discover new things and absorb it to my daily life.

In this blog you will see a lot things not just technology related. Since I am starting a new cycle in my life, I'm gonna use this space to share with you a lot of different thoughts that I hope can be useful for you too!

So if you have some interesting projects you'd like to share or any other topics to discuss, you can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/matheus-santos) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mightyeus).

Thank you and see you next time,

Mat.
